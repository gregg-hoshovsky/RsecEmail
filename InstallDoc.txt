THe installation created two programs
a) A Testing/configuration Application.THis has a separate document  TBD.
b) THe Email Reminder Job. The follwoing requirements must be met for this to run
	THis job needs to be set into a windows schedule job to run once a day.  
	It must operate under a Sharepoint service account wirh full control
	It must have the SMTP portion configured in MasterConfig.txt
	IT must have a file create per Sharpoint App/List.
	The application must run in the same folder as the configuration files.
	The current state of logging is via the Console, so that must be recirected to a log file
		eg. EmailAddinDaemon 1>> output.txt 2>&1
